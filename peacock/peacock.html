        <div class="intro">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content1">"Peacock" redirects here. For the streaming service, see Peacock (streaming service). For other uses, see Peacock (disambiguation).</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content2"><strong>Peafowl</strong> is a common name for two bird species in the genera Pavo and within the tribe <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">Pavonini</a> of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as <strong>peacocks</strong>, and female peafowl are referred to as <strong>peahens</strong>, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks".</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content3">The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia; The Congo peafowl is not a true peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content4">The functions of the elaborate <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">iridescent</a> colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content5">A group of peacocks is called an <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">"ostentation"</a> or a "muster".</div>

        <br>

      <div id="description">
        <div class="heading-content-2">Description</div>
        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content6">The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content7">Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">iridescence</a>. Both males and females have spurs.</div> 
        <br>
        <div class="content8">The Congo peacock <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">(Afropavo congensis)</a> male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content9">Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content10">Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls. Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.</div>

        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content11">Peafowl are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous. In common with other members of the <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">"Galliformes"</a>, the males possess metatarsal spurs or "thorns" on their legs used during intraspecific territorial fights with some other members of their kind.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content12">In courtship, vocalisation stands to be a primary way for peacocks to attract peahens. Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the "song" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation</div>

        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content13">Peafowl are omnivores and mostly eat plants, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;"> arthropods</a>, reptiles, and amphibians. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other arthropods and small mammals. Indian peafowl also eat small</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content14">Domesticated peafowl may also eat bread and cracked grain such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice and sometimes cat food. It has been noticed by keepers that peafowl enjoy protein-rich food including larvae that infest <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">granaries</a>, different kinds of meat and fruit, as well as vegetables including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and peas</div>

        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content15">The peafowl is native to India and significant in its culture.[citation needed] In Hinduism, the Indian peacock is the mount of the god of war, Kartikeya, and the warrior goddess Kaumari, and is also depicted around the goddess Santoshi.[29] During a war with Asuras, Kartikeya split the demon king Surapadman in half. Out of respect for his adversary's prowess in battle, the god converted the two halves into an integral part of himself. One half became a peacock serving as his mount, and the other a rooster adorning his flag. The peacock displays the divine shape of Omkara when it spreads its magnificent plumes into a full-blown circular form.[30] Peacock feathers also adorn the crest of the god Krishna.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content16">Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire, was born an orphan and raised by a family farming peacocks. According to the Buddhist tradition[which?], the ancestors of the Maurya kings had settled in a region where peacocks (mora in Pali) were abundant. Therefore, they came to be known as "Moriyas", literally, "belonging to the place of peacocks". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara ("Moriya-city"), which was so called, because it was built with the "bricks coloured like peacocks' necks".[31] After conquering the Nanda Empire and defeating the Seleucid Empire, the Chandragupta dynasty reigned uncontested during its time. Its royal emblem remained the peacock until Emperor Ashoka changed it to a lion, as seen in the Lion Capital of Ashoka, as well in his edicts. The peacock continued to represent elegance and royalty in India during medieval times; for instance, the Mughal seat of power was called the Peacock Throne.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content17">Peacocks (often a symbol of pride and vanity) were believed[by whom?] to deliberately consume poisonous substances in order to become immune to them, as well as to make the colours of their <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">resplendent</a> plumage all the more vibrant – seeing as so many poisonous flora and fauna are so colourful due to aposematism, this idea appears to have merit. The Buddhist deity Mahamayuri is depicted seated on a peacock. Peacocks are seen supporting the throne of Amitabha, the ruby red sunset coloured archetypal Buddha of Infinite Light.</div>

    <div id="breeding">
        <div class="heading-content-6">Breeding and colour variations</div>
        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content18">Hybrids between Indian peafowl and Green peafowl are called <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">Spaldings</a>, after the first person to successfully hybridise them, Keith Spalding.[citation needed] Spaldings with a high-green phenotype do much better in cold temperatures than the cold-intolerant green peafowl while still looking like their green parents. Plumage varies between individual spaldings, with some looking far more like green peafowl and some looking far more like blue peafowl, though most visually carry traits of both</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content19">In addition to the wild-type "blue" colouration, several hundred variations in colour and pattern are recognised as separate morphs of the Indian Blue among peafowl breeders. Pattern variations include solid-wing/black shoulder (the black and brown stripes on the wing are instead one solid colour), pied, white-eye (the ocelli in a male's eye feathers have white spots instead of black), and silver pied (a mostly white bird with small patches of colour). Colour variations include white, purple, Buford bronze, opal, midnight, charcoal, jade, and taupe, as well as the sex-linked colours purple, cameo, peach, and Sonja's Violeta. Additional colour and pattern variations are first approved by the United Peafowl Association to become officially recognised as a morph among breeders. Alternately-coloured peafowl are born differently coloured than wild-type peafowl, and though each colour is recognisable at hatch, their peachick plumage does not necessarily match their adult plumage.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content20">Occasionally, peafowl appear with white plumage. Although albino peafowl do exist,[citation needed] this is quite rare, and almost all white peafowl are not <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">albinos</a>; they have a genetic condition called leucism, which causes pigment cells to fail to migrate from the neural crest during development. <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">Leucistic</a> peafowl can produce pigment but not deposit the pigment to their feathers, resulting in a blue-grey eye colour and the complete lack of colouration in their plumage. Pied peafowl are affected by partial leucism, where only some pigment cells fail to migrate, resulting in birds that have colour but also have patches absent of all colour; they, too, have blue-grey eyes. By contrast, true albino peafowl would have a complete lack of melanin, resulting in irises that look red or pink. Leucistic peachicks are born yellow and become fully white as they mature.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content21">The black-shouldered or Japanned mutation was initially considered as a subspecies of the Indian peafowl (P. c. nigripennis) (or even a separate species (P. nigripennis))[58] and was a topic of some interest during Darwin's time. Others had doubts about its taxonomic status, but the English naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) presented firm evidence for it being a variety under domestication, which treatment is now well established and accepted. It being a colour variation rather than a wild species was important for Darwin to prove, as otherwise it could undermine his theory of slow modification by natural selection in the wild. [59] It is, however, only a case of genetic variation within the population. In this mutation, the adult male is melanistic with black wings</div>

        <hr style="margin-top: -1px;">
        <div class="content22">In ancient Rome, peafowl were served as a delicacy.[60] The dish was introduced there in approximately 35 B.C. The poet <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration:none;">Horace</a> ridiculed the eating of peafowl, saying they tasted like chicken. Peafowl eggs were also valued. Gaius Petronius in his Satyricon also mocked the ostentation and snobbery of eating peafowl and their eggs.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content23">During the Medieval period, various types of fowl were consumed as food, with the poorer populations (such as serfs) consuming more common birds, such as chicken. However, the more wealthy gentry were privileged to eat less usual foods, such as swan, and even peafowl were consumed. On a king's table, a peacock would be for ostentatious display as much as for culinary consumption.</div>
